# Lists Directory

Welcome to the `lists` directory! This directory is intended to store various wordlists used for reconnaissance, scanning, subdomain enumeration, fuzzing, and other initial phases of information gathering in a penetration test (pentest).

Within the `lists` directory, you'll find several subdirectories. Each of these subdirectories contains specific wordlists that are used by the tool.

## Customization

You have the flexibility to add your own wordlists or directories containing wordlists to this directory. 
This allows you to customize the tool in the `config.py` document.
